w2: unpredictable something 

It was snowing heavily the other day. I took a video of the crazy flying snow. youtube link: http://youtu.be/n_br7cOI9io

w3: wave 

I found a video that documents crowds on the street in high speed. Faces of strangers that you normally don't remember after you met are enlarged in this video. I feel the way the crowds move is a wave.
